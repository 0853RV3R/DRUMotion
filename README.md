What is DRUMotion?
Stroke victims and survivors of serious accidents often suffer from impaired hand-eye coordination and dexterity. When patients are discharged from intensive rehabilitation centres, it is difficult to motivate them to continue the physical therapy exercises necessary to improve their mobility. DRUMotion is a video game designed specifically to aid recovering stroke patients in increasing their mobility and hand-eye coordination in a fun and musical way, all in the comfort of their own homes.
